# Personal Website

This is the repository for housing my personal website.
I built it entirely using Cursor/AI tools as a means of learning how to better
use the tools. \
Look at LLM.md for instructions on creating PRD markdown files that you can
feed to your AI agent to make new features. \
The actual data is written in the `content/projects` and `content/blogs` markdown files

## Commands
```
cd personal-blog
npm run dev
npm run generate:projects
npm run build
```
