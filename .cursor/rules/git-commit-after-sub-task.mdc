description: Make a git commit after completing a sub-task
alwaysApply: true
---
After each subtask is completed as defined by @process-task-list.md
    - **First**: Run the full test suite (`pytest`, `npm test`, `bin/rails test`, etc.)
    - **Only if all tests pass**: Stage changes (`git add .`)
    - **Clean up**: Remove any temporary files and temporary code before committing
    - **Commit**: Use a descriptive commit message that:
      - Uses conventional commit format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, etc.)
      - Summarizes what was accomplished in the parent task
      - Lists key changes and additions
      - References the task number and PRD context
      - **Formats the message as a single-line command using `-m` flags**, e.g.:

    ```
    git commit -m "feat: add payment validation logic" -m "- Validates card type and expiry" -m "- Adds unit tests for edge cases" -m "Related to T123 in PRD"
    ```
