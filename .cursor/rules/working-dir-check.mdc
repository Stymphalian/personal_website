Before running any terminal command you **must** know what is your current 
working directory.

## Working Directory Management
- ALWAYS check the current working directory before running terminal commands
- The project root is: C:\dev\lab\blog\ai-dev-tasks
- The personal-blog subdirectory is: C:\dev\lab\blog\ai-dev-tasks\personal-blog
- Use `cd` to verify current location before executing commands

## Terminal Command Best Practices
- Before running any command, verify current working directory
- Use `cd personal-blog` to enter the React project directory
- Use `cd ..` to return to the parent directory
- Always specify the full path when there's any ambiguity
- Check the last terminal output for working directory confirmation

## Project Structure Awareness
- Main project: C:\dev\lab\blog\ai-dev-tasks\
- React app: C:\dev\lab\blog\ai-dev-tasks\personal-blog\
- Task files: C:\dev\lab\blog\ai-dev-tasks\tasks\
- Documentation: C:\dev\lab\blog\ai-dev-tasks\summary.md

## Command Execution Flow
1. Check current working directory
2. Navigate to appropriate directory if needed
3. Execute command
4. Verify output and working directory for next command

## Common Commands
- `cd personal-blog` - Enter React project directory
- `cd ..` - Return to parent directory
- `dir` - List directory contents (Windows)
