# Chat Summary: Personal Blog & Portfolio PRD and Task Generation

## Project Overview
Created a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a personal blog and portfolio website designed to showcase technical skills and projects. The site targets potential employers/recruiters while providing educational value to the developer community.

## Key Requirements/Decisions
- **Design**: Minimal, professional aesthetic with VSCode-inspired interface using black-white-crystal blue color scheme and monospaced fonts
- **Tech Stack**: React 18+ with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite build tool
- **Pages**: Home (bio + project carousel), Projects (card layout), Individual Project pages (detailed blog posts), Blog section, Contact
- **Features**: Responsive design, markdown support, SEO optimization, Docker deployment to DigitalOcean
- **Content**: Initially showcase 3 projects with ability to add monthly, support for live demos and heavy JavaScript

## Deliverables Created
1. **PRD Document** (`prd-personal-blog.md`): Detailed requirements covering functional specs, design considerations, technical implementation, and success metrics
2. **Task List** (`tasks-prd-personal-blog.md`): 8 main tasks with 58 sub-tasks covering project setup, component development, SEO optimization, and deployment
3. **React Project Setup**: Initialized with Vite + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS with custom theme, organized directory structure
4. **Code Quality Tools**: ESLint + Prettier configuration with React/TypeScript rules, accessibility standards, and VS Code integration

## Implementation Approach
The task list follows a phased approach: Phase 1 (MVP) focuses on core structure and navigation, Phase 2 adds detailed functionality, and Phase 3 covers deployment and optimization. Each task includes specific file paths and testing requirements for comprehensive development coverage.

## Next Steps
Ready to begin implementation following the detailed task breakdown, starting with project setup and configuration. The foundation is complete with React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + ESLint/Prettier, and the next task is setting up Jest testing framework with React Testing Library.
